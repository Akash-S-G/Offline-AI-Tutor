# Offline Tutor App (Separate Module)

This module is a separate app scaffold from `ai_tutor` and is intended for staged implementation of the full offline tutor platform.

## Stage 1 Implemented

- Course -> Subject -> Chapter hierarchy (SQLite-backed)
- Chapter-anchored tutor chat flow
- Prompt builder with student-friendly output format
- Language selector (English/Kannada toggle in UI)
- Inference bridge contract wired to existing native channels:
  - MethodChannel: `offline_tutor/llm`
  - EventChannel: `offline_tutor/llm_stream`

## Stage 2 Implemented (Simple RAG)

- SQLite schema upgraded with `rag_chunks` table
- Seed syllabus chunks added for initial chapters
- Chapter-filtered lexical retrieval service added (`SimpleRagService`)
- Prompt augmentation with retrieved context before inference

  - `RagRepository.ingestChapterNotes(...)`

## Stage 3 Implemented (Structured Persistence)

- Chat session persistence tables added:
  - `chat_sessions`
  - `chat_messages`
- Learner progress table added:
  - `learner_progress`
- Chat now resumes from the latest chapter session automatically
- Questions asked counter persists and updates per chapter

## Stage 4 Implemented (Retrieval Upgrade)

- SQLite FTS index added for `rag_chunks` search
- Trigger-based FTS sync added on insert/update/delete
- Retrieval pipeline upgraded to FTS-first + lexical rerank fallback
- Embedding metadata scaffold table added:
  - `rag_chunk_embeddings`
- Ready for your next input resources to begin embedding indexing

## Stage 5 In Progress (Embedding Workflow Scaffold)

- Added chapter-level embedding indexing service
- Added indexing action in chapter chat app bar
- Added live embedding coverage status in chapter header:
  - `Embeddings: indexed/total`
- Notes ingestion now refreshes embedding coverage stats

## Stage 6 Started (P2P Foundation)

- Added Android P2P manager scaffold (`P2PManager`) with offline peer status and discovery flow
- Added Flutter P2P channel service (`offline_tutor/p2p`)
- Added P2P screen with transport status and peer list
- Added Home screen entry point for P2P panel
- Added network permissions for local transfer

Current scope is discovery/status foundation. File transfer handshake and payload sync will be added in the next increment.

## Stage 7 Implemented (Model Selection + Bundle Protocol)

- Added model selection screen with native channel integration:
  - current model path and metadata
  - pick `.gguf` file and apply via `setModelPath`
- Added P2P chapter bundle protocol in Flutter layer:
  - export chapter RAG chunks to JSON bundle
  - manifest with payload hash (SHA-256)
  - import with integrity verification and safe ingestion
- Added Home app bar actions for:
  - model selection
  - P2P sharing

## Stage 8 Implemented (Native Wi-Fi LAN Transfer)

- Replaced Bluetooth transfer with faster Wi-Fi LAN socket transfer:
  - start/stop receiver mode (TCP)
  - UDP broadcast peer discovery on local network
  - send selected bundle file to discovered peer by LAN IP
  - receive incoming bundles into native inbox (`files/p2p_inbox`)
- Extended P2P method channel with transfer APIs:
  - `startReceiver`
  - `stopReceiver`
  - `sendBundle`
  - `listReceivedBundles`
- Upgraded P2P UI with:
  - receiver controls
  - target peer selector
  - send last exported bundle action
  - native inbox listing

## Stage 9 Implemented (Peer Trust Controls)

- Added trusted peers table in SQLite:
  - `trusted_peers`
- Added trusted peer repository for persist/untrust/list operations
- Send flow is now trust-gated:
  - selected peer must be explicitly trusted before bundle transfer
- Added trust/untrust controls in P2P screen for selected LAN peer
- Added trusted status indicator in discovered peer list
- Added one-tap import action for bundles received in native inbox

## Stage 10 Implemented (LAN-First Routing + Wi-Fi Direct Fallback)

- Native peer discovery now routes with policy:
  - LAN first (UDP discovery + TCP transfer)
  - Wi-Fi Direct discovery fallback when LAN peers are unavailable
- Added route visibility in status payload:
  - active transport
  - route decision
  - route policy string
- P2P UI now displays route decision/policy and supports mixed peer transport labels

## Stage 11 Implemented (Runtime Local-Network Permission UX)

- Added Android runtime permission APIs on P2P method channel:
  - `getPermissionStatus`
  - `requestPermissions`
- Added P2P UI permission card for Android 12+/13+ flow:
  - location grant state
  - nearby Wi-Fi grant state
  - one-tap permission request action
- Wi-Fi Direct discovery now checks required runtime permissions before fallback scan

## Stage 12 Implemented (Receiver Approval Gate)

- Receiver now creates a pending incoming transfer request before writing any bytes to inbox
- Incoming transfers require explicit accept/reject decision from app UI
- Added pending transfer APIs on P2P channel:
  - `listPendingIncomingTransfers`
  - `approveIncomingTransfer`
  - `rejectIncomingTransfer`
- Added P2P UI for pending requests:
  - accept/reject actions
  - alert dialog prompt for new pending transfer
- If no decision is provided within timeout window, transfer is rejected automatically

## Stage 13 Implemented (Wi-Fi Direct Handshake Transfer Path)

- Added native Wi-Fi Direct connection handshake during send flow for direct peers
- Added route resolution from Wi-Fi Direct peer address to IPv4 transfer target using:
  - connection info (group owner route)
  - ARP/group lookup fallback when local device is group owner
- Added resolved route caching for Wi-Fi Direct peers
- P2P peer list now shows resolved route when available
- Send flow now supports both:
  - LAN peers (direct IPv4)
  - Wi-Fi Direct peers (auto route resolution + transfer)

## Stage 14 Implemented (Signed Manifest Verification)

- Bundle manifest upgraded with authenticity signature:
  - `payloadSignature` using `HMAC-SHA256(sharedSecret, payloadJson)`
  - `signatureAlgo: hmac-sha256`
- Import now verifies both:
  - payload hash integrity
  - HMAC signature authenticity
- Added shared-secret management in P2P UI for signed export/import workflow

## Stage 15 Implemented (Receiver Trust Policy)

- Added persisted P2P security settings in SQLite (`p2p_settings`):
  - shared secret
  - auto-accept trusted peers policy
- Trusted peer records now support alternate address mapping for direct/LAN route matching

  - throughput (bytes/sec)
  - ETA estimate (seconds)
- Added live telemetry panel in P2P UI with periodic polling:
  - send progress bar + speed + ETA
  - receive progress bar + speed + ETA
  - error display for failed transfers

## Stage 17 Implemented (Shared-Secret Key Rotation with Grace Period)

- Added key rotation state management in P2P security repository:
  - current shared secret
  - previous shared secret (grace-period tracking)
  - configurable grace window (1-72 hours)
- Receiver/import now verifies against active + grace-period secrets:
  - old bundles signed with previous secret remain valid during grace
  - automatic cleanup of expired previous secret on app refresh
- Added key rotation UI controls in P2P screen:
  - grace window duration selector (1/6/12/24/48/72 hours)
  - rotate button with new secret validation
  - active grace period status display with expiry countdown

## Stage 18 Implemented (Secure Bootstrap Token Exchange with QR/Share)

  - mastery_score: computed metric (0-100) based on engagement
- Added mastery calculation algorithm:
  - 30% weight: questions asked (min 10% per question, max 100%)
  - 30% weight: sessions engaged (min 15% per session, max 100%)
  - 40% weight: message engagement (0.5% per message, max 100%)
  - Formula: 0.3*questionScore + 0.3*sessionScore + 0.4*messageScore
- Added mastery level classification:
  - Beginner: 0-49 (initial engagement phase)
  - Intermediate: 50-79 (active learning phase)
  - Advanced: 80+ (mastery phase)
- Added progress dashboard screen with:
  - overall mastery across all chapters (average %)
  - per-chapter progress cards showing:
    - chapter title + last activity timestamp
    - mastery level badge (color-coded)
    - linear progress bar (animated to mastery score)
    - detailed metrics: questions, messages, sessions
  - chapter list sorted by most recent activity
  - "No progress" state when no chapters engaged
- Added progress tracking integration:
  - recordQuestionAsked() called when user submits question
  - recordChatMessage() called after both user and assistant messages
  - recordNewSession() available for future session tracking
  - automatic mastery score recalculation on each interaction
- Added dashboard entry point in home screen:
  - trending_up icon in AppBar (new progress button)
  - navigates to ProgressDashboardScreen
  - displays alongside model selection + P2P sharing buttons

## Structure

- `lib/features/course` - hierarchy models and local repository
- `lib/features/home` - context selection flow
- `lib/features/chat` - tutor chat, gateway abstraction, prompt builder

## Important Constraint

The optimized runtime architecture is preserved:

Flutter UI -> EventChannel -> Kotlin -> JNI -> C++ (llama.cpp)

No heavy inference logic is moved into Flutter.

## Next Steps (Remaining Learning Intelligence Features)

1. Add actual embedding generation model inference and vector storage
2. Add vector similarity retrieval and hybrid reranking
3. Add multilingual retrieval tuning (English + Kannada term expansion)
4. Add chapter mastery prerequisites enforcement (gated learning paths)
5. Add spaced-repetition scheduling for review chapters
6. Add personalized difficulty adjustment based on mastery progression
